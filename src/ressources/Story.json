  "background_story1": "Me: That night was horrible. Bandits attacked me out of nowhere. I ran into the dark forest—branches hit my face, the trees were thick, and I could barely see. They kept chasing me. I realized... they didn’t want my money. They wanted me. I ran until I saw a road with carriages. I screamed, 'Help!' But before anyone could reach me, something hit the back of my head... then everything went black.",

  "background_story2": "Me: Ugh... Where am I? This room... it's beautiful. Soft mattress under me... golden decorations on the walls... Am I dreaming? Wait—who's that man sitting there?",

  "background_story3": "King: You're awake. Good. I’m the king of this land. I have a task for you—actually, three quests. And you must complete them.",

  "background_story4": "Me: Wait, what? Why am I here? What do you want from me?",

  "background_story5": "King: When you cried out for help and collapsed, my guards heard you. I was in one of the passing carriages. We brought you here to recover. You’re safe now... for the moment.",

  "background_story6": "Me: I see... I'm grateful, but why did you help me?",

  "background_story7": "King: Out of brotherly duty... and because I have a mission for you. Complete it, and you may stay here, serve under my protection, and never be homeless again.",

  "background_story8": "Me: And if I say no?",

  "background_story9": "King: You don’t have a choice.",



  "intro": "You wake up in a dark dungeon. A quiet voice calls from far away...",
  "truhe_geoeffnet": "The chest creaks open. You find a rusty dagger.",
  "soldat_entdeckt": "A soldier walks in. You hold your breath...",
  "gewonnen": "You found the princess. You both escape the castle!",
  "verloren": "You were caught. The castle is now your prison."
